# React CV ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

This repository contains the source code for my React-based curriculum, which is intended to be hosted and accessible on the Vercel website.

## What problem does it solve?

Creating a CV as a PDF file may seem easier and faster initially, but the process becomes cumbersome when updates or additions are required. Each change could potentially disrupt the design coherence, necessitating numerous adjustments.

Additionally, managing separate CVs for multiple languagesâ€”English and Portuguese, in this caseâ€”demands substantial time and effort in the long run. This method becomes increasingly impractical over time.

In contrast, developing a React-based CV may appear more complex and time-consuming at first, but it offers streamlined maintenance in the long term. The CSS rules automatically ensure a consistent design, while React components provide modularity, allowing for sections to be conveniently organized in different files.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to craft a straightforward yet highly maintainable CV that enables seamless updates without compromising its design integrity.

Furthermore, the aim was to host the CV online, allowing prospective recruiters to effortlessly switch between the English and Portuguese language versions. This approach ensures accessibility and convenience for recruiters, enhancing their understanding of my qualifications and experience.

It's also possible to download the CV by clicking on the button provided for this action.
