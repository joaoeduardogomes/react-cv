# React CV ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

This repository contains the source code for my React-based curriculum, which is intended to be hosted and accessible on the Vercel website.

## What problem does it solve?

Creating a CV as a PDF file may seem easier and faster initially, but the process becomes cumbersome when updates or additions are required. Each change could potentially disrupt the design coherence, necessitating numerous adjustments.

Additionally, managing separate CVs for multiple languagesâ€”English and Portuguese, in this caseâ€”demands substantial time and effort in the long run. This method becomes increasingly impractical over time.

In contrast, developing a React-based CV may appear more complex and time-consuming at first, but it offers streamlined maintenance in the long term. The CSS rules automatically ensure a consistent design, while React components provide modularity, allowing for sections to be conveniently organized in different files.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to craft a straightforward yet highly maintainable CV that enables seamless updates without compromising its design integrity.

Furthermore, the aim was to host the CV online, allowing prospective recruiters to effortlessly switch between the English and Portuguese language versions. This approach ensures accessibility and convenience for recruiters, enhancing their understanding of my qualifications and experience.

## Lessons learned & challenges

This project provided an excellent opportunity to revisit and enhance my React and Next.js skills, with a particular focus on utilizing React hooks effectively.

One of the notable challenges I encountered was prioritizing the utilization of the Tailwind CSS framework for styling the page. Despite having worked with this technology in the past, I gained a deeper understanding of its applications during the course of this project. The process of styling the project allowed me to significantly broaden my familiarity with Tailwind CSS and its features.
